Open access to data, often generated by multi-group collaborations with large datasets, is increasingly central to scientific endeavour. It conveys many benefits including research transparency, efficiency and collaboration and is becoming a requirement for many journals and grant funding bodies. Therefore, scientists need easy, cost effective and user-friendly systems to make data accessible to collaborators and the public and transform research culture. We have tested several data architecture systems for use with neuroscience datasets and selected GIN as the most flexible, easy to use and reliable system. We have adapted this for use within University of Bristol (UoB) IT systems. Bristol-GIN and the accompanying Bristol Neuroscience Data Guide are under development and scheduled to be launched in Autumn 2022.
